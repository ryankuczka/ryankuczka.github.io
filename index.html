        This site is now Jekyll powered, however, it used to be run by Django.
        I originally built it using Django because I had several ideas of how
        to build it where a framework like Django would be useful. I was also
        very familiar with Django and since this is my first site built from
        scratch, it seemed like a good idea.
        </p>

        <p>
        After building the Django site, I learned about Jekyll and started
        reading about it and was surprised to learn that much of what Jekyll
        does, I had built my Django site to do similarly. Therefore, I decided
        to switch over to Jekyll to power my site, which ended up being relatively
        simple to do. You can now see the Django powered site (which will no longer
        be updated) at the links below.
