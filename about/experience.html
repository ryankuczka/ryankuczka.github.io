    <h3>YCharts - Economic Data Developer</h3>
    <p>At YCharts, I built up and maintained a large economic indicator data set.
    This included the web scraping system used to schedule and import new data
    as it is released.</p>

    <p>I also worked on the infrastructure. I migrated our static assets to Amazon S3,
    implementing a system to version each file, in order to cache bust URLs. This
    also involved creating a system, using redis, to store the current version
    of each filename. This allowed for an asynchronous deploy to have a worker
    machine process and upload the static files, then when the web server is
    updated, all that is necessary is to point them at the new versions. I plan to
    detail this more in a future blog post.</p>

    <p>I currently love my job, and I could not have chosen a better place to
    learn and grow as a developer and look forward to many more new experiences!</p>
