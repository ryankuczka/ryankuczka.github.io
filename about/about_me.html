    <p>
        I graduated from NYU in December 2012 with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Economics.
        I always loved computers and enjoy programming. I have experience with Python, and many Python
        frameworks including Django. I also have experience with Javascript and the AngularJS framework.
        I enjoy tinkering with my dev environment in my free time and always love learning
        new tools to use in my day to day job.

        I grew up in Longmont, CO and despite calling it Lamemont when I first moved away, I always
        love going back to the crisp, clean, thin air of Colorado. Ice hockey and viola were two of my
        passions growing up, however, after moving to New York, I haven't been able to pursue them although
        I'd love to get back into it.

        On weekends, I love to spend time with my wife and daughter and just hang out playing games
        and watching TV and movies. We are members of both the American Museum of Natual History and
        the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and always enjoy spending a day at either place. Some of my best
        memories have happened at AMNH including spending a night in an almost empty museum and sleeping
        underneath the famous blue whale, attending the Math for America Fall Function underneath said whale,
        and most of all, proposing to my wife next to the giant meteorite on the first floor (where we had
        our first picture together).
