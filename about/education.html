<h2>Education</h2>
<h3>New York University</h3>
<p>I graduated from New York University in January 2013 with a
Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Mathematics. This was a rigorous
degree across both disciplines.</p>

<p>I took many math courses, including the full Calculus and Analysis track,
Linear Algebra, Number Theory, Combinatorics, and Probability. My life long
passion for math was pushed to its limits, but these courses were always
interesting.</p>

<p>For the economics portion of my degree, the courses were focused on
a rigorous understanding of the theory behind economics. These included
heavily math based courses in Micro and Macroeconomics, Statistics,
Econometrics, Game Theory, and a topics course on Economics and Psychology
which focuses on Choice Theory. These courses were a great way to see
math applied to the world, much of the time a far cry from the pure math
I was used to.</p>

<h3>Niwot High School</h3>
<p>I received an International Baccalaureate High School diploma from
Niwot High School in Niwot, CO. I received the top score of 7 on both
my Mathematics HL and Physics HL tests.</p>

<p>I also participated in the Symphony Orchestra. It was in this orchestra
that I performed at the Lincoln Center in New York City, a trip which first
introduced me to my current home. We placed 3rd in the National Orchestra Cup
competition that year, and I made many life-long friends.</p>
