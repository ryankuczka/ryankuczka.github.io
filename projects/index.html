        Last December, I discovered a wonderful programming challenge site called <a href="http://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a>.
        I had a lot of fun working through the challenges every day leading up to
        Christmas and I started a Github repo to track my solutions.

        I started out doing the challenges in python since that is what I am most familiar with.
        After accomplishing <em>most</em> of the challenges in python, I decided to teach myself
        some C++ for a few of the challenges. Lately, I've been starting to attempt the challenges
        in other languages such as Javascript and Golang to broaden my programming language horizons.

        You can read instructions for running the code on the Github repo below.

        This site is now Jekyll powered, however, it used to be run by Django.
        I originally built it using Django because I had several ideas of how
        to build it where a framework like Django would be useful. I was also
        very familiar with Django and since this is my first site built from
        scratch, it seemed like a good idea.
        </p>

        <p>
        After building the Django site, I learned about Jekyll and started
        reading about it and was surprised to learn that much of what Jekyll
        does, I had built my Django site to do similarly. Therefore, I decided
        to switch over to Jekyll to power my site, which ended up being relatively
        simple to do. You can now see the Django powered site (which will no longer
        be updated) at the links below.
