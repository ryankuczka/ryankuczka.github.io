It's been a long time since my first post! It's hard for me to usually keep
a blog updated, bu I am constantly thinking of things I want to say, but
never having anyone to say it to, or forgetting about it when I have a chance
to. Due to that, I am going to try to start just writing a post about these things.

Tomorrow, I am going to my first hockey game in a long time! My dad is in town
for work so I am going to meet up with him tomorrow night to see the Rangers-Sabres
game at Madison Square Garden. I haven't been to a hockey game in about 4 years
and haven't really paid any attention to the NHL in longer than that, but it
will be awesome to finally see a game at MSG!

Tonight, however, once Sam gets back from the gym, we're carving pumpkins!
I'm not too sure what I will carve mine with but it should be fun! This year,
we have to be careful not to let Mel eat any of the pumpkin, or get too close
once we put candles in them! I can't believe it's been almost a year since we
got her!

For those who don't know, Sam is my wonderful girlfriend and Mel (short for Melody)
is our cat. I have wanted to get a cat for a long time, but Sam would always say
she hated cats and could never get one. Then, in a moment of weakness, I was told
"Let's just fill out the cat foster application." The next day, I got a call, and
a couple days later, Mel was coming home with us!

Sam still wasn't sold on the cat idea, especially when all she did was hide under
the couch when we first brought her home. But that first night, Sam got up to go
to the bathroom and Mel went and sat on her lap, purring and loving all the pets
that Sam gave her and from then on, she's been our baby. It's even to the point
where Sam constantly reminds me that she gets Mel in the divorce!

Anyways, back to hockey and my dad. After the game, I get to stay in a hotel
about a 10 minute walk from my office. A sign of the things to come when we
move back to Manhattan next spring! Then, Friday night, my dad and I are finally
going to get out to <a href="http://brooklynbrewery.com/verify">Brooklyn Brewery</a>
to taste some beers, then we'll hit up <a href="http://www.lomzynianka.com/">Lomzynianka</a>
for Polish grub afterwards. All in all, this is looking to be a fun weekend!
